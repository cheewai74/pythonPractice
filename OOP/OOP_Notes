Self provides a convenient way to access and modify an object within a method

#Using id() to determine if object is mutable or immutable

# Using dir() to determine which built-in attributes are present
print(dir(MyInstance))

using is to determine if both object is the same.

help('__class__')

class method only works with class data, it doesn't know about any data associated with an instance data

# Difference between is and ==
An is expression evaluates to True if two variables point to the
same (identical) object.
An == expression evaluates to True if the objects referred to by
the variables are equal (have the same contents).
