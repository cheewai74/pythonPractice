F-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals.
It should be noted that an f-string is really an expression evaluated at run time,
not a constant value.

name = 'Wong'
title = 'full stack hacker'
print(f'{name} is a {title}.')
# Wong is a full stack hacker.

pi = 3.1415926
print(f'Pi is approximately equal to {pi:.2f}')
# Pi is approximately equal to 3.14

id = 1  # need to print a 3-digit number
print(f"The id is {id:03d}")
# The id is 001

N = 1000000000  # need to add separator
print(f'His networth is ${N:,d}')
# His networth is $1,000,000,000
