Like dictionaries they contain keys that are hashed to a particular value.
But on contrary, it supports both access from key value and iteration,
the functionality that dictionaries lack.

Note:
nametuples are immutable

Access by index : The attribute values of namedtuple() are ordered
                  and can be accessed using the index number unlike dictionaries
                  which are not accessible by index.

Access by keyname : Access by keyname is also allowed as in dictionaries.

using getattr() :- This is yet another way to access the value by giving namedtuple
                   and key value as its argument.

Conversion Operations
_make() :- This function is used to return a namedtuple() from the iterable passed as argument.

_asdict() :- This function returns the OrderedDict() as constructed from the mapped values of namedtuple().

using “**” (double star) operator :- This function is used to convert a dictionary into the namedtuple()

_fields :- This function is used to return all the keynames of the namespace declared.

_replace() :- This function is used to change the values mapped with the passed keyname.
