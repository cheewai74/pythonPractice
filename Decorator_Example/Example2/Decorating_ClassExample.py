"""
    Python decorators are used for decorating class methods,

    @property is used to create property attributes that can only be accessed
    through its getter, setter, and deleter methods.

    @staticmethod and @classmethod are used to define class methods that are not connected
    to particular instances of the class.

    @staticmethod donâ€™t require an argument.
    @classmethod take the class as an argument.
